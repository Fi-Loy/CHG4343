Design Project Outline, 2024
Important Dates:
Preliminary Submission Due Date: November 13th by 4 pm
Code Due Date: December 4th by 4 pm
Technical Report Due Date: December 9th by 4 pm
1. Introduction
Your team has been hired by a client company to develop a tool for simulating gas-phase reactions in an adiabatic or isothermal packed bed reactor (PBR). The project specifications call for an object-oriented simulator that can predict:

The composition of the output of a PBR,
The conversion of the limiting reactant,
The concentration of other species,
The pressure in the reactor,
The temperature of the fluid as a function of the weight of the packing.
2. Project Objectives
The objectives of this project are:

To develop a Java-based program capable of simulating reactions in a PBR.
To validate this object-oriented program using the test case given in this document.
To write a detailed technical report describing the program.
3. Coding Objectives
The Java program must be able to perform the following tasks:

Simulate any gas-phase reaction in an adiabatic or isothermal PBR. The input information for the reactor must be read from a text file.
Calculate the reactant conversion, species concentration, pressure, and, if necessary, the temperature of the reactor's content as a function of the length of the reactor or weight of the packing. These values must be written into a CSV file. The simulator must output concentration profiles for all species in the reactor.
The simulator must handle gas-phase reactions with any specific rate law. For simplicity, you may validate the simulator using reaction rates based on power laws of reactant concentrations. Look for cases where you can compare the Java-based solutions to analytical ones as part of the validation process.

From a programming perspective, your code should employ object-oriented programming concepts, including polymorphism, inheritance, interfaces, cloning, exception handling, and file I/O. (Note that your program may not need to incorporate all these components to receive a passing grade, but the best submissions will include them.)

A test case is provided in Section 3.1 to validate your program, and the results must be discussed in the report.

3.1 Test Case
Consider a PBR with a single gas-phase reaction:
ùê¥ ‚Üí ùêµ + 2C
and input properties as listed in Table 1. If properly designed, your simulator should predict the temperature, conversion, pressure, and concentration profiles shown in Figure 1 (adiabatic) and Figure 2 (isothermal).

4. Submission of Preliminary Work and Final Project Files
All submissions must be done in your design team's channel in a folder called "Submissions." This folder should contain three sub-folders: one for each submission ("Preliminary Report", "Final Code", and "Final Report"). Please follow the naming formats provided in this section; submissions will not be accepted if the naming format is incorrect.

4.1 Preliminary Submission (Due November 13th by 4 pm)
This submission must include three items: an Excel file, a PDF file, and a compressed folder containing your most recent code.

The Excel file should contain a solution for the test case. Feel free to use other simulators to obtain this solution, but ensure the work is your own.
The PDF must include at least these three parts:
A design proposal for your program in the form of a flowchart or equivalent.
A written description of your current program design, including plans for the final design. This description must not exceed 8 pages. It may not be your final design, but it will be used to ensure that you are on the right track.
A detailed task sheet showing the allocation of work done and work yet to be completed.
For this stage of the project, it is acceptable to use basic numerical methods (e.g., Euler‚Äôs method) to solve the test case and get your code working, with the expectation that your final design will implement more suitable numerical methods. Your code should also include concise comments explaining its execution.

Note: For full marks, you need to implement a variable mode PBR with a variable reaction and independent ODE solver.
